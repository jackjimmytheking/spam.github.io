        <p>
            This domain has been flagged and removed by the <b>National Bureau of Consumer Protection</b>. 
            Evidence gathered indicates that this site was being utilized for <b>criminal scamming and phishing activities</b>
            amounting to a total of <b>$32.8 million dollars</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Investigation Findings</b>: Evidence indicates that all <b>romantic or friendly relationships</b> established on this 
            platform were entirely fraudulent. Digital forensics revealed that these interactions were not real; they were 
            orchestrated by organized groups operating out of <b>Turkey</b>.

            These actors utilized <b>Generative AI</b> to produce synthetic imagery and deceptive text messaging to mimic human connection. 
            This was a deliberate ploy to emotionally manipulate victims and extract money through the purchase and transfer of 
            <b>platform coins</b>.
